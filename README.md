The Project is split into three notebooks:

1. EDA Notebook
2. Convert DCIM to Jpg
3. Capstone Project CNN Modeling

The CNN modeling notebook utulizes the first two notebooks for the modeling process. 

## Project Goals:
To use the given sets of chest x-rays and train a neural network to help identify whether the model can predict pneumonia in a particular patient. This project is part of the much larger Covid-19 Detection Kaggle Competition, but the scope of this project is the binary classification of the presence of pneumonia in a patient.  

## Data
The Data used in the project is from the Kaggle competition. The Original image Dataset is around 110GB in size, and hence the approach in this project has been to convert the images into a format that is much smaller in size and hence accessible. Initial EDA was done on Kaggle.

## Next Steps:
The project will be built upon, to include multi-class classification and also perform localization on the chest x-rays.
