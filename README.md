The Project is split into three notebooks:

1. EDA Notebook
2. Convert DCIM to Jpg
3. Capstone Project CNN Modeling

The CNN modeling notebook utulizes the first two notebooks for the modeling process. 

## Project Goals:
To use the given sets of chest x-rays and train a neural network to help identify whether the model can predict pneumonia in a particular patient. This project is part of the much larger Covid-19 Detection Kaggle Competition, but the scope of this project is the binary classification of the presence of pneumonia in a patient. 

## Next Steps:
The project will be built upon, to include multi-class classification and also perform localization on the chest x-rays.
